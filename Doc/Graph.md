1. Toolbar Menu

    An explanation of the different buttons:
    1.1. "Apply Changes" Process the Graph.

    1.2. "Graph settings" show on the Details Panel the propertys of the graph.

    1.3. "Compile Materials" MultiPacker uses some materials on the internal Process to do the Output Texture, you need to press this button and compile all the materials who MultiPacker Graph needs, on the future I will try to set this automatically on the first run. Without the materials compiled the Output Texture will be show black.

    1.4. "Save" this saves the Graph

    1.5. "Browse" Show on the Content Browser where is the MultiPacker Graph Asset.

2. Graph Nodes

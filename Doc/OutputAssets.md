## MultiPacker Graph

![MPGraph](/Images/assetMP.jpg)

- This is the default Asset of MultiPacker.
- The Graph process all the nodes to get the Assets Outputs, **all the Nodes are a Reference on the Asset**.
- The goal of MultiPacker is to have on minimal textures what you need, alowing you to save space, time loading and time developing with a fast system to work with them.
- Because for that **include the MultiPacker Graph on your Final Project is an Error**, if you include the Asset all the references will be included also, with the result you dont save space at all.
- All the Data needed for the nodes are on the MultiPacker Database Asset.
